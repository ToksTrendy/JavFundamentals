/**
 *OOP languages refer to languages that use objects in programming,
 * they use objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code,  implement real-world entities
 * like inheritance, hiding(encapsulation), polymorphism etc.

 * 6 paradigm behind it:
 * 1. Access modifiers: defines the access types i.e. what is accessible/can be access by a program/application
 * In java, there are 4 access modifiers: public, private, protected, default(package private)

 * public: accessible in all classes in app
 * private: accessible within a class that is defined
 * protected: Accessible within a package that is defined and also subclasses of the class even
 * if they are in another package
 * default: does not have any syntax, accessible within a class and its package

 * 2. Return type:  data type value that is returned by a method or void when nothing is returned

 * 3. Method name: name of the method within a class, it should start with small letter and best camel casing convention

 * 4. parameters: are comma separated arguments pass into a method, it is preceded by their data type. It can also be empty

 * 5. Exceptions: Are the expected errors that a method can throw i.e. that can occur in a method

 * 6. Method body: Is where the actual behaviour is implemented, is a block of code.

 * OOP CONCEPTS
 * They are majorly 4 namely: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism

 * Abstraction: identifying only the required characteristics of an object*

 *  Encapsulation
 * Data hiding.
 * It is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
 * It is the mechanism that binds together the code and the data it manipulates.
 * Is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
 * So, the terms “encapsulation” and “data-hiding” are used interchangeably.

 * Inheritance:
 * It is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class.
 * Let us discuss some frequently used important terminologies:
 * Superclass: The class whose features are inherited is known as superclass (also known as base or parent class).
 * Subclass: The class that inherits the other class is known as subclass (also known as derived or extended or child class).
 * The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.
 * Reusability: Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”,
 * i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want,
 * we can derive our new class from the existing class.
 * By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.

 * Polymorphism:
 * It refers to the ability of object-oriented programming languages to differentiate between entities
 * with the same name efficiently.
 * This is done by Java with the help of the signature and declaration of these entities.
